## Résumés

Hello! I am [Dhruv Bhanushali](https://dhruvkb.github.io/), an engineering
graduate from the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee. I am a software
developer and technical writer, based on the time of day and the phase of the
moon. 

These here are my résumés and the

files that I use to generate them.

### Note

A basic LaTeX installation probably won't contain the following 
packages. Use `tlmgr` to install them manually.

- titlesec
- hyphenat
- enumitem

The command to build the PDF of the résumé is as follows.

```bash
$ xelatex resume.tex
```
