## Résumés

Hello! I am [Dhruv Bhanushali](https://dhruvkb.github.io/), an engineering
graduate from the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee. I am a software
developer and technical writer among many other things, based on the time of day
and the phase of the moon.

These here are my résumés and the
<img src="readme_assets/latex.png" height="16">
files that I use to generate them.

### Note

A basic LaTeX installation probably won't contain the following 
packages. Use `tlmgr` to install them manually.

- `titlesec`
- `hyphenat`
- `enumitem`

The command to build the PDF of the résumé is as follows.

```bash
$ xelatex resume.tex
```

You can also use `latexmk` to setup a watch and build process. But you will 
probably need to install it using `tlmgr` too.
